Java client for Caldecott

JavaTunnel.java shows how to setup and start a tunnel.

How to run this tunnel test:

You can either use the 'tunnel.sh' shell script or use the mvn exec target. Optionaly override the VCAP target with -Dvcap.target=http://api.vcap.me or some other cloud url to run against a local cloud.

Maven:
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.cloudfoundry.caldecott.JavaTunnel"

Script:
./tunnel.sh

This implementation doesn't deploy the Cladecott app at this point so  you should test the tunnel with 'vmc tunnel' first.
